Install
=======

Node.js::

   npm install newforms

Browser bundles (all dependencies included):

* `newforms.js`_ - 232KB (54KB gzipped)

* `newforms.min.js`_ - 83.9KB (23.4KB gzipped)

Browser bundles currently expose:

* newforms as a ``forms`` variable.
* a ``require()`` function which can be used to access bundled dependencies:

  * `Concur`_ - sugar for inheritance
  * `DOMBuilder`_ - interchangeable DOM Element / HTML generation
  * `isomorph`_ - miscellaneous utilities

Usage
=====

As direct porting from Django is nearing completion, the resulting API is
very much focused on the server side. As such, Node.js is probably the
best place to use newforms in anger at the moment, as you'll be working
with a request/response cycle, which is Django forms' usual mode of
operation.

Client side features, such as hooking into the DOM for instant validation
and feedback, will be the focus of future work.

In lieu of guide documentation, head over to the `Django forms documentation`_
for a quick overview of the concepts behind this form library.

Here's a quick guide to getting started with newforms.

.. _`Django forms documentation`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/

* For Node.js, if you clone this repo and install `express`_ and `jade`_ via
  ``npm``, you can run ``node demo/demo.js`` to see a basic example of newforms
  in action.

  All example code will assume you've imported like so::

     var forms = require('newforms')

  .. _`express`: http://expressjs.com/
  .. _`jade`: http://jade-lang.com/
  .. _`npm`: http://npmjs.org/

* For convenience and compactness, the ``new`` operator is **optional** when
  using newforms' Fields, Widgets and other constructors which are commonly used
  while defining a Form, such as ValidationError -- however ``new`` is **not**
  automatically optional for the Form and FormSet constructors you create.

* Form constructors are created using the ``forms.Form`` constructor's
  ``extend()`` function, which comes courtesy of `Concur`_. This takes an
  ``Object`` argument defining form fields and any other properties for the
  form's prototype (validation methods etc.), returning a constructor which
  inherits from ``BaseForm``::

     var ContactForm = forms.Form.extend({
       subject  : forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
     , message  : forms.CharField()
     , sender   : forms.EmailField()
     , ccMyself : forms.BooleanField({required: false})
     })

     var form = new ContactForm()

* FormSet constructors are created using the ``forms.formsetFactory`` function,
  which takes a Form constructor and any additional properties for the FormSet's
  prototype defined as an ``Object``, returning a FormSet constructor which
  inherits from ``BaseFormSet``::

     var ArticleForm = forms.Form.extend({
       title   : forms.CharField()
     , pubDate : forms.DateField()
     })

     var ArticleFormSet = forms.formsetFactory(ArticleForm, {extra: 1})

     var formSet = new ArticleFormSet()

* Custom row styling: ``requiredCssClass`` and ``errorCssClass`` can be added to
  any form and the classes will be applied to each matching row in the form
  output. To add extra CSS classes to a particular row, pass the 
  ``extraClasses`` property in the field definition. All of the above are added
  to the class attribute of the **containing** element, e.g., ``<tr>``, ``<li>``
  or ``<p>``::

     var PostForm = forms.Form.extend({
     // Fields
       postTitle        : forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
     , postBody         : forms.CharField({extraClasses: 'larger island'})
     , allowComments    : forms.BooleanField({required: false})
     // CSS settings
     , requiredCssClass : 'required'  // A class to style required fields
     , errorCssClass    : 'error'     // A class to style fields with errors
     })

* The API is largely consistent with Django's API, with the following
  rules of thumb for converting between the two:

  * Where Django accepts keyword arguments, in Javascript a single
    ``Object`` argument is expected, with arguments expressed as its
    properties.

    Note that this applies *anywhere* Django accepts a keyword argument,
    even if the convention in Django is topass certain keyword arguments
    positionally, e.g. when passing in POST data to a Form constructor.

    *Django (by convention)*::

       f = MyForm(request.POST)

    *Javascript*::

       var f = new MyForm({data: req.body})

  * Method and variable names which use ``underscores_in_python`` become
    ``camelCasedInJavaScript``.

  * As mentioned above, the ``new`` operator is optional for newforms
    form components.

    *Django*::

       forms.CharField(max_length=100)

    *JavaScript* (the following lines are equivalent)::

       new forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})
       forms.CharField({maxLength: 100})

  * Due to limited cross-browser support for properties in JavaScript,
    Form and FormSet properties from Django such as ``cleaned_data`` and
    ``errors`` become method calls; e.g. ``cleanedData()`` and ``errors()``.

    It's ugly, but it works everywhere.

  * Objects which would be coerced to a string for display in Django,
    such as Forms, FormSets and ErrorLists, have a ``defaultRendering()``
    method.

    This is required because newforms can output DOM Elements or HTML
    from the same objects and there's no standard ``toDOM()``-type method
    in JavaScript. If you're operating in HTML mode, you can coerce these
    objects to string to get HTML out of them, as their ``toString()``
    methods make use of ``defaultRendering()``.

The unit tests exercise the library thoroughly, so dip in for examples of
further usage in the meantime.
