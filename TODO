TODO
====

These are not exhaustive lists. They're for quick reference when I have a bit of
time free to port more of the changes which have been made since the original
port was done in June 2008 (of which there are many!)

Change histories for the most relevant Django modules can be found here:

* http://code.djangoproject.com/log/django/trunk/django/forms/fields.py?mode=follow_copy
* http://code.djangoproject.com/log/django/trunk/django/forms/forms.py?mode=follow_copy
* http://code.djangoproject.com/log/django/trunk/django/forms/formsets.py?mode=follow_copy
